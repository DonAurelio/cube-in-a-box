    "# ALOS-2 - Global Mosaic \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains general information about ALOS-2 and demonstrates how to retrieve and visualise the indexed ALOS-2 global mosaic products.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Radar Wavelength\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active system operating in the microwave domain of the electromagnetic spectrum. Microwaves are not visible to the human eye and provide a very different view of the world from what we are used to. \n",
    "\n",
    "While optical remote sensing sensors function similar to the human eye ‚Äì they are passive sensors which record reflected sunlight ‚Äì a radar sensor operates more like a flash camera in a dark room. The radar emits a light pulse and records the part of the pulse that is reflected, or scattered, back to the sensor (hence the term backscatter). Unlike sunlight which is non-polarised and comprises a large range of different wavelengths, radar is a laser which operates within narrow and well-defined wavelength bands, and at a specific polarisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the ALOS Missions\n",
    "\n",
    "The Japanese Earth observing satellite program run by JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) consists of two series of sensor types: those satellites used for atmospheric and marine observation, and those used mainly for land observation. The Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) mission utilizes advanced land-observing technology for cartography, regional observation, disaster monitoring, and resource surveying.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PALSAR-2 instrument aboard ALOS-2 is a Synthetic Aperture Radar, which emits microwave and receives the reflection from the ground to acquire information. Since it does not need other sources of light, such as the sun, SAR has the advantage of providing satellite images regardless if it's day or night. The transmitting and receiving microwave frequency of PALSAR-2 is L-band, which is less affected by clouds and rain. These all-weather and night observing capabilities are suitable for rapid disaster monitoring. In addition, L-band microwave can partially penetrate through vegetation and reach the ground to obtain information about vegetation and ground surface.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Global Yearly Mosaic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The global 25 m resolution PALSAR/PALSAR-2 mosaic is a seamless global SAR image created by mosaicking SAR images of backscattering coefficient measured by PALSAR/PALSAR-2, where all the path within 10x10 degrees in latitude and longitude are path processed and mosaicked for the sake of processing efficiency. Correction of geometric 2 distortion specific to SAR (ortho-rectification) and topographic effects on image intensity (slope correction) are applied to make forest classification easy. The size of one pixel is approximately 25 meter by 25 meter.\n",

    "The HH and HV polarisations measure direct backscatter, which occurs when the transmitted L-Band signal is reflected directly back to the sensor by a single reflection, by a surface oriented perpendicular to the radar illumination direction. It results in a strong co-polarisation (HH or VV) reflection and appears bright in the SAR image. Rock outcrops or bare mountain slopes oriented towards the radar can produce direct backscattering. At the short C-band wavelength,  the leaves in a dense vegetation canopy can also cause direct scattering.\n",
